                <p class="text-faded">
                     <p>
Big data is a term for data sets that are so large or complex that traditional data processing application software is 
	    inadequate to deal with them,  Big data is being generated by everything around us at all times. 
	   <br> Every digital process and social media exchange produces it:</p>
	    
	    <h3><font color="black">Characteristics of Big Data</font></h3>
	<ul>
	 <li>Volume
         <li>Velocity
          <li>Variety		 
	</ul>

<h2><font color="black">Some Examples of Big Data in Real Life Scenarios</font></h2> 

    <ul>
      <li>Big volumes of data </li>
      <li>IT log analytics </li>
      <li>Call center analytics</li>
      <li>Social media analysis</li>
      <li>Fraud detection  </li>
      <li>Website Analytics </li>
      <li>Voice and/or video content on devices </li>

    </ul>

	<h2><font color="black">Critique or Critical Analysis in Big Data</font></h2>
	In summary, Ongoing development of best practices for real-time analysis of big data should continue to be a priority for businesses and government agencies. <br>
	Each company will need to carefully assess whether pros of such big data use outweigh the cons for their particular case; the answer to that question will vary widely from business to business. 
	<br>Adoption of best practices and close attention to changes in the way we think about big data,
	however, will be important to all businesses.
	<br>
    <h2><font color="black">Technologies that have been born because of Big Data</font></h2>
	As the data volumes grow, so does the need for efficient and effective storage techniques. The main evolutions in this space are related to data compression and storage virtualization, these are some of the technologies that emerged out of big data;
	    <ul>
      <li><b><font color="black">Predictive analytics:</font></b> software and/or hardware solutions that allow firms to discover, evaluate, optimize, and deploy predictive models by analyzing big data sources to improve business performance or mitigate risk.</li>
      <li><b><font color="black">NoSQL databases: </font></b>key-value, document, and graph databases. </li>
      <li><b><font color="black">Data virtualization:</font></b> A technology that delivers information from various data sources, including big data sources such as Hadoop and distributed data stores in real-time and near-real time</li>
      <li><b><font color="black">Stream analytics: </font></b>software that can filter, aggregate, enrich, and analyze a high throughput of data from multiple disparate live data sources and in any data format.</li>
      <li><b><font color="black">Distributed file stores:</font></b> A computer network where data is stored on more than one node, often in a replicated fashion, for redundancy and performance.  </li>
      <li><b><font color="black">Hadoop Hadoop</font></b> This is by far the most popular implementation of MapReduce, being an entirely open source platform for handling Big Data. It is flexible enough to be able to work with multiple data sources, either aggregating multiple sources of data in order to do large scale processing, or even reading data from a database  </li>
          </ul>
	
	<h2><font color="black">Big Data in the context of Uganda</font></h2>
	<b>Uganda produces a lot of good data….....</b><br>
	<b>The Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS)</b> is regarded as one of the best national statistics offices in Africa. It curates data collected by itself and a range of administrative systems. It publishes a range of nationally aggregated statistics on a relatively timely basis.
         <p><br>
Equally, governments need to invest in big data so as to be able to do proper budgeting and adequately deliver services like education, health care. Unfortunately,
several government departments in Uganda have no capacity to generate their own data.<br>
<br>Players in the private sector want government and private businesses to embrace big data and data analytics, an area they say remains unexplored in Uganda. 
		 They say the country is lagging behind in capacity building in data management which otherwise would be a critical tool in effective planning by these entities.
		<br> uganda has got many other departments that have data in big volumes, volcity and of different variety,ie:
		 <ul>
		 <li>The National ID project generates volumes of data
		<li>Uganda National Examination Bord (UNEB)
		 <li>Uganda communications Center (UCC)
		 <li>Census Data
		 <li>Organizations working in logistics, financial health data
		 <li>Public social media
		 <li>etc
			 </ul>
For business intelligence to work effectively, companies must ensure that they integrate the in house process of generation and analysis of big data
 <br>Amutujo said; “Progressive countries have managed to develop because they have prioritized data generation and analysis. 
<br>Uganda’s priorities need to change if it is to realize its development agenda.”
Siya Mthethwa the Head of Data Management and Consulting at Stanbic Bank Uganda explained that businesses are moving from the traditional model of market assessment to using data analytics.
<br><br>“Companies like Uber, Facebook and Amazon now rely on big data to study their customer or user preferences. 
		 If you buy a book on Amazon, the next day you log in, there are higher chances they will suggest books for you to buy,” he said.

	<h3><font color="black">A case study scenario of Big Data in Uganda</font></h3>
A wide range of consultations has taken place in Uganda to review the progress made towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and developing the Post-2015 national development agenda. 
In support of the process, Pulse Lab Kampala has developed a technical toolkit and interactive dashboard to further incorporate the “voices of the people” into the planning process. 
Pulse Lab Kampala analysed a dataset comprising 3.1 million messages from UNICEF’s U-report platform to understand the views of Ugandan youth on Post-2015 development topics.
The analysis revealed that ‘Better Health Care,’ ‘Good Education’ and ‘Better Job Opportunities’ are top priorities for the youth that participated in the digital surveys conducted by UNICEF.
